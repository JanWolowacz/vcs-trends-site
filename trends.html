                <p>Gitops made you able to do pull and push requests. Very neat feature
                    for modern project creation. Once the change is being made <b>an
                    automated system applies the changes to the server.
                    </b>
                </p>
<br>
                <p>DevOps is basically Gitops, but made for developers. With Devops
                    you can oush and pull the code and applies changes automatically.

<h1>History of VCS</h1>

            <p>At the beginning version control systems (VCS) were centralized.
                One server stored the true copy of a project. But they had one
                major flaw: <b>if the server broke, nobody could access their
                projects.</b> Therefore a new version control system arrived. It was
                Distributed version control systems didn't have such flaw and
                are widely used nowadays. Most popular is github with over 100 million
                developers.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>Mercurial and Github were competing in being the one VCS for everyone.
                Mercurial was straight-forward and Github was more complex. Surprisingly,
                the more complex option won and Mercurials is currently used only by few
                projects.</p>
